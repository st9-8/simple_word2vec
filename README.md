# simple_word2vec
Here is some simple methods from scratch used in NLP to Transform Text to Vector.

In this repository, there are 3 methods coded.

* Count Vector
* One Hot Encoding
* TF-IDF(Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency)

The second part will be some more complex methods based on Neural Networks which take in account the context of words before the representation.

These methods are:
* Skip-Gram
* CBOW (Continuous Bag Of Words)
